## Abstract
Pneumonia is a common and potentially fatal lung infection that affects millions of people worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis of pneumonia is crucial for timely treatment and prevention of complications. This study proposes a novel approach for binary pneumonia classification by combining the U-Net architecture with a classical convolutional neural network (CNN). By integrating the robust biomedical segmentation of U-net, we aim to enhance the network's ability to localize and extract important features associated with pneumonia. We evaluate our method on a publicly available dataset of chest X-ray images from Kaggle and achieve very high results. This work contributes to advancing the field of medical image analysis and has the potential to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing and treating pneumonia more effectively.
